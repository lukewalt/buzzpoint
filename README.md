# BuzzPoint

BuzzPoint is an app that communicates a city’s growth by capturing a user rating of an area/object/place and posting that to a city zone/boro. This form of communication will yield a more vivid picture of HOW a city is growing in real time. It will also be a helpful daily update for public transit choices, new art installations, restaurants, parks etc. The client will be fun and subjective user experience for the user and the governing metro body ( or to whom it may concern ) will be able to derive insights based on aggregate feedback ( proper data coupling ) from the population that will make solutions clearer as the city looks to expand and optimize its growth.

BuzzPoint uses Google Maps API reverse geocoding logic which converts geographic coordinates of the post into a human-readable address
